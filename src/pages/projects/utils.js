            show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. This project is a desktop application built using Java Swing to
            provide a rich graphical user interface that replicates the show's format and gameplay mechanics.The 
            game includes essential features such as a series of progressively challenging questions and an
             engaging score system to simulate the authentic experience of the TV show. Additionally, 
             I implemented lifelines, such as "50-50" and "Ask the Audience," to enhance the gameplay and make it
            more dynamic.To ensure the robustness and reliability of the application, I utilized JUnit for unit 
            testing, covering both the logic and user interface components. The project was built and managed with
             Gradle, which streamlined the development and dependency management process.This project showcases
            my skills in Java programming, UI design with Swing, and implementing core software development
            principles such as testing and build automation. It was a rewarding experience that allowed me to 
            combine creativity with technical expertise while adhering to best practices in software engineering.`,
